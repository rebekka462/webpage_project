    <h1>System Management</h1>
    <p>System management is essential for keeping computers running efficiently and reliably. It involves monitoring and controlling hardware components, managing software operations, and ensuring that all system processes run smoothly. Below are some of the key areas that make up system management:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>I/O Communication & Device Management</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQkngXz7Pbzc5RgtzZ7p23pg-T5fSTcoYwV9g&s" alt="I/O Communication">
        </div>
        <p class="section-heading">Overview:</p>
        <p>Device management allows the system to communicate and interact with hardware devices like keyboards, printers, and storage drives. The operating system uses device drivers—small software programs—to translate commands from the system into actions the hardware can perform. This ensures that data flows smoothly between devices and the system, improving overall performance and usability.</p>
        <p>It also handles tasks such as buffering, queuing, error detection, and scheduling, making sure each device operates efficiently without conflict.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Buses</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Computer_system_bus%28fixed%29.svg/1200px-Computer_system_bus%28fixed%29.svg.png" alt="System Bus Architecture">
        </div>
        <p class="section-heading">Overview:</p>
        <p>A bus is a communication system that transfers data between different parts of a computer. It connects the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, allowing them to share information quickly and efficiently. The three main types of buses are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> Transfers actual data between components.</li>
            <li><strong>Address Bus:</strong> Carries the addresses of data in memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Bus:</strong> Sends control signals to manage operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modern systems also use buses like PCI, USB, and SATA to support additional hardware and devices.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Firmware</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://computerle.com/wp-content/uploads/firmware.webp" alt="Firmware Example">
        </div>
        <p class="section-heading">Overview:</p>
        <p>Firmware is a type of software stored permanently in a computer’s hardware. It controls low-level operations of devices and is usually the first program to run when a device is powered on. For example, the BIOS or UEFI firmware starts the boot process and prepares the system to load the operating system.</p>
        <p>Firmware plays a vital role in making hardware work properly and can sometimes be updated to fix bugs or improve performance.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Boot Process</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wjWc0sSBV1VWRr374WHm7g.jpeg" alt="Boot Process Diagram">
        </div>
        <p class="section-heading">Overview:</p>
        <p>The boot process is the sequence of steps a computer takes when it is turned on, preparing the system for use. It includes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Power-On Self Test (POST):</strong> The system checks hardware components for errors.</li>
            <li><strong>BIOS/UEFI:</strong> Initializes devices and locates the bootable drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Bootloader:</strong> Loads the operating system into memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Operating System Launch:</strong> The OS takes over and starts essential services and the user interface.</li>
        </ol>
