            <h2>Data Representation</h2>
            <p>This section will cover various aspects of data representation in computers. We will explore binary numbers, hexadecimal, ASCII, Unicode, and different data types like integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans. Understanding how data is encoded and stored is fundamental to computer science.</p>
            <h3>Binary System</h3>
            <p>At the heart of computing lies the binary system, using only two digits: 0 and 1. This allows for the representation of all types of data through combinations of these bits.</p>
            <p>For example, the decimal number 5 is represented as  1 0 1 in binary.</p> 
            <h3 >Number systems</h3>
            <p>Besides binary,computers also work with other number systems like decimal(base-10),hexadecimal(base-16)and octal(base-8).Each system have it's advantagesin specific contexts.</p>
            <h4>Data Types</h4>
            <p>Computers handle different types of data, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. Each type has a specific way of being represented in memory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers, can be signed or unsigned.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Floating-point:</strong> Numbers with decimal points, represented using standards like IEEE 754.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Characters:</strong> Letters, symbols, and digits, often represented using ASCII or Unicode.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> Logical values, either true or false, typically represented by 1 and 0 respectively.</li><br>
            </ul>

                Enable efficient instruction execution,
                 Support complex calculations and 
                 Improve overall system performance.</p><p>The Control Unit (CU) acts as the CPU's brain, deciding what to do. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is its muscle, performing calculations. Registers are the workbench, holding the data for these operations. Efficiently managed registers, directed by the CU to feed the ALU, are key to the CPU's speed in executing complex programs.
